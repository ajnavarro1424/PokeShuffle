PokeShuffle shows the user an outline image of a Pokémon and challenges the user to guess its identity. Each correct answer progresses the streak count and loads a new Pokémon, and an incorrect answer decrements the remaining guesses until it reaches zero. The game ends when there are no more guesses remaining.
