# PokeShuffle

PokeShuffle is a game inspired from the Pokémon tv series pre-commercial break segment "Who's that Pokémon?". In this segment the audience would attempt the guess the idenitiy of a pokémon based on its obscured outline image, with the answer being revealed after the return from commerical break.

PokeShuffle shows the user an outline image of a Pokémon and challenges the user to guess its identity. Each correct answer progresses the streak count and loads a new Pokémon, and an incorrect answer decrements the remaining guesses until it reaches zero. The game ends when there are no more guesses remaining.
